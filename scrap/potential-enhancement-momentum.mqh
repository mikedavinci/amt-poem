you are a metatrader exper advisor developer world class expert.

provide a prompt for this: our constants and strategy works great with short time frames like 15 and 30 minute time frames. However i believe if we also make sure our trade opens in the direction of the momentum from a 4 hour time frame it might improve the probability. Consider this and tell me what you think or what approach can be better?

Hereâ€™s a concise and actionable prompt tailored for your strategy:

Objective: Enhance the existing strategy that works well on 15- and 30-minute time frames by incorporating the momentum direction from the 4-hour time frame to improve trade probabilities.

Task:

Momentum Analysis:

Define momentum using a 4-hour moving average (e.g., 50-period or 100-period) or an indicator like RSI, MACD, or ADX.
Determine the momentum direction (e.g., upward if the 4-hour moving average is sloping up, or MACD histogram is positive).
Trade Filters:

Allow trades only when the direction of momentum in the 4-hour chart aligns with the signal generated on the 15- or 30-minute chart.
Example: If the 4-hour momentum is bullish, only open long positions on the shorter time frames; block short trades.
Backtesting:

Test the strategy with and without the 4-hour momentum filter over historical data.
Analyze key metrics like win rate, profit factor, and drawdown.
Optimization:

Evaluate different momentum thresholds (e.g., varying moving average periods or MACD signal lines) to find the optimal filter settings.
Compare performance on various market conditions (trending vs. ranging).
Implementation:

Incorporate the 4-hour momentum filter logic into the Expert Advisor (EA).
Ensure minimal latency in switching between the 4-hour and lower time frames for momentum checks.
Deliverables:

An enhanced EA with the momentum filter from the 4-hour chart integrated.
A performance comparison report showing the impact of the momentum filter on overall trade probabilities and profitability.
