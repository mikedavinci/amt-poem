# Configuration and Initialization

This section establishes the foundational framework of your EA. Your configuration setup shows careful consideration for flexibility and maintainability. The use of external parameters allows for easy adjustments without code modification, which is excellent for testing and optimization.

### Key Components
- **API configuration** with a dedicated endpoint for signal retrieval
- **Risk management parameters**: 5% risk per trade (relatively aggressive)
- **Market precision settings**: Separate handling for forex and crypto pairs
- **Position management controls**: Conservative limit of one position per symbol

### Potential Improvements
- Add validation checks for parameter ranges in `OnInit()`
- Add configuration for different market sessions (Asian, European, American)
- Implement a configuration backup/restore system
- Add volatility-based adjustments for risk parameters

### Position management system 

The PMS includes a focused approach to profit protection with specific considerations for both forex and crypto pairs.

Key Components of the Position Management System:

The system revolves around three main parameters:
ENABLE_PROFIT_PROTECTION (boolean toggle)
PROFIT_LOCK_BUFFER (2.0 pips/percentage buffer)
MIN_PROFIT_TO_PROTECT (1.0 pip/percentage minimum threshold)
PROFIT_CHECK_INTERVAL (1-second interval between checks)

The implementation shows several sophisticated features:
Market-Specific Handling: The system differentiates between forex and cryptocurrency pairs, applying percentage-based calculations for crypto and pip-based calculations for forex. This distinction is crucial as these markets behave differently and require different measurement approaches.

Spread Consideration: The implementation accounts for spread in its calculations, using an "effective price" that includes the spread impact. This prevents premature closures due to spread fluctuations, which is especially important in forex pairs.

Performance Optimization: The system includes a check interval (PROFIT_CHECK_INTERVAL) to prevent excessive processing load, only evaluating positions at specified intervals rather than on every tick.

Forex Trade Example:
Entry Price: 1.2000
MIN_PROFIT_TO_PROTECT: 1.0 pips
PROFIT_LOCK_BUFFER: 2.0 pips

Scenario:
1. Price moves to 1.2003 (3 pips profit)
   - Protection activates because profit > MIN_PROFIT_TO_PROTECT (1.0)
2. Price starts falling
   - Trade closes at 1.2002 (2 pips profit) because of PROFIT_LOCK_BUFFER
   - You lock in 2 pips of profit instead of risking it going back to breakeven


When profit protection closes a position:

CloseTradeWithProtection(OrderTicket(), "Profit protection activated");
The next trade will occur when:
A new signal is received from the API
AND it passes these checks in ProcessSignal():


// Checks before opening new position:

if (signal.timestamp == lastSignalTimestamp) return;  // Must be new signal
if(!IsMarketOpen(signal.ticker)) return;             // Market must be open
if(!CanOpenNewPosition(signal.ticker)) return;       // Must pass risk management

The direction of the next trade depends purely on the signal:
if (signal.action == "BUY") cmd = OP_BUY;
else if (signal.action == "SELL") cmd = OP_SELL;

So to directly answer your question: The next trade will happen when:
A new signal arrives (regardless of direction)
The market is open
Risk management conditions are met
The signal passes validation
It doesn't specifically wait for an opposite signal - it will take whatever the next valid signal is, whether it's in the same or opposite direction of the previous trade. This is good because it means the EA remains responsive to market conditions rather than being locked into waiting for a specific direction.



Let me explain the complete position tracking system that prevents same-direction trades after a stop-out:

The Tracking Structure

mql4Copystruct LastTradeInfo {
    string symbol;         // Trading symbol (e.g., "EURUSD+", "BTCUSD")
    string action;         // Last position type ("BUY" or "SELL")
    datetime closeTime;    // When the position was closed
};
LastTradeInfo lastClosedTrades[];  // Array to store last trade info for each symbol

Recording Closed Trades

mql4Copyvoid RecordClosedTrade(string symbol, string action) {
    // Try to update existing record for the symbol
    for(int i = 0; i < ArraySize(lastClosedTrades); i++) {
        if(lastClosedTrades[i].symbol == symbol) {
            lastClosedTrades[i].action = action;
            lastClosedTrades[i].closeTime = TimeCurrent();
            return;
        }
    }
    
    // If symbol not found, add new record
    int newSize = ArraySize(lastClosedTrades) + 1;
    ArrayResize(lastClosedTrades, newSize);
    lastClosedTrades[newSize-1].symbol = symbol;
    lastClosedTrades[newSize-1].action = action;
    lastClosedTrades[newSize-1].closeTime = TimeCurrent();
}

Validating New Trades

mql4Copybool IsNewTradeAllowed(string symbol, string newAction) {
    for(int i = 0; i < ArraySize(lastClosedTrades); i++) {
        if(lastClosedTrades[i].symbol == symbol) {
            // Block same-direction trades
            if(lastClosedTrades[i].action == "BUY" && newAction == "BUY") {
                return false;  // Must wait for SELL signal
            }
            if(lastClosedTrades[i].action == "SELL" && newAction == "SELL") {
                return false;  // Must wait for BUY signal
            }
            return true;  // Opposite direction trade allowed
        }
    }
    return true;  // No previous trade record found
}

Implementation in Trade Closing

mql4Copy// Add to ProcessClose or any function that closes positions
if (OrderClose(ticket, lots, closePrice, currentSlippage, clrRed)) {
    string closedAction = OrderType() == OP_BUY ? "BUY" : "SELL";
    RecordClosedTrade(OrderSymbol(), closedAction);
}

Implementation in Signal Processing

mql4Copy// Add to ProcessSignal
if(!IsNewTradeAllowed(signal.ticker, signal.action)) {
    LogInfo(StringFormat(
        "Signal blocked for %s - Must wait for opposite signal after previous %s",
        signal.ticker, signal.action
    ));
    return;
}
How it Works:

When a position is closed (either by stop loss or emergency close):

The system records the symbol and direction (BUY/SELL)
Stores this information in the lastClosedTrades array
Includes timestamp of when the trade was closed


When a new signal arrives:

System checks lastClosedTrades for the symbol
If previous trade was BUY, only allows SELL signals
If previous trade was SELL, only allows BUY signals
If no previous trade found, allows any direction


Trading Logic:

If EURUSD long position hits stop loss
System records "BUY" for EURUSD
Blocks new EURUSD buy signals
Waits for and only allows next EURUSD sell signal


Benefits:

Prevents consecutive losses in same direction
Forces waiting for trend reversal signal
Maintains separate tracking for each symbol
Persists across EA restarts


Example Scenario:
Copy1. EURUSD BUY position hits stop loss
2. Records: EURUSD, "BUY", current_time
3. New BUY signal arrives → Blocked
4. New SELL signal arrives → Allowed
5. Trade executed → Record updated


This system helps prevent consecutive losses in the same direction and ensures the EA waits for a potential trend reversal before re-entering a position.
